                    hand"; and -λογία, -logia[2]) is the sum of techniques, skills, methods, and processes used in the
                    production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific
                    investigation. Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be
                    embedded in machines to allow for operation without detailed knowledge of their workings. </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic
                tools. The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire and the later Neolithic Revolution increased the
                available sources of food, and the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their
                environment. Developments in historic times, including the printing press, the telephone, and the
                Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a
                global scale. </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Technology has many effects. It has helped develop more advanced
                economies (including today's global economy) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class. Many
                technological processes produce unwanted by-products known as pollution and deplete natural resources to
                the detriment of Earth's environment. Innovations have always influenced the values of a society and
                raised new questions in the ethics of technology. Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency
                in terms of human productivity, and the challenges of bioethics.</p>

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Future of Technology</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Philosophical debates have arisen over the use of technology, with
                disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it. Neo-Luddism,
                anarcho-primitivism, and similar reactionary movements criticize the pervasiveness of technology,
                arguing that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as
                transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society
                and the human condition.</p>
